The structure of the R file is to look at EDA of the dataset and fit various unsupervised machine learning methods to identify relationships in the data. If relationships in the data cluster together, this can be used to determine methodologies of choosing players to join a team. Like in the film "Moneyball" it is critical for players to get on base so any relationships that correlate or are predicitive on getting on base will be an attribute to focus on when scouting for a team.
